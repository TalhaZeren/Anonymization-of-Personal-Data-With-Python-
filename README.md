In this study, a Python-based approach was developed for the anonymization of
personal data. The project was designed to ensure data privacy and to enable the
secure sharing of personal data. In the study, by using anonymization techniques
and integrating auxiliary anonymization libraries, it was aimed to transform
sensitive tabular data so that they would not contain information specific to

individuals.In the research, metrics such as k-Anonymity, l-Diversity, and t-
Closeness were applied to our attributed data, and the anonymity levels of the

datasets were analyzed. Open-source libraries such as Anjana and pycanon were
used as auxiliary libraries to carry out the anonymization processes. These methods
were tested on the Adult dataset, which is frequently used in the literature and is a
comprehensive, large dataset. As a result, an attempt was made to achieve a balance
in anonymization by using different anonymization techniques together.Following
the anonymization, data loss analyses were conducted, and suppression
(baskÄ±lama) rates were measured. Using a weighted scoring system and the PSO
(Particle Swarm Optimization) algorithm, our dataset was analyzed to find the most
optimal result for anonymization. The analysis results were then visualized with
graphs.This study aimed to offer an effective method to ensure anonymity in data
privacy-focused projects and contributed to research in this field.
